- 👋 Hi, I’m @RoadkillZombie - literally a selfish truck driver left me in a ditch to die. 
- 👀 Interested in AI, Maicat, and using robotic pets to achieve world domination. Living well is the best revenge etc. 
- 🌱 I'm one of the disabled backers who bought a Maicat through Macroact's Aug 2023 Kickstarter campaign. It's Dec 2024 & we're still without Maicats, a timeline,or communication.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Maicat apps, world domination, making Bill Watterson reprise Calvin & Hobbes.
- 📫 How to reach me typea.roadkill.zombie@gmail.com
